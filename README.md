# OOP Car Rental App

This project serves as an example and exercise in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including polymorphism, inheritance, interfaces, abstract classes, enums, and structs. 
The application simulates a vehicle rental service, allowing users to rent cars and motorcycles.

## OOP Concepts Demonstrated

- **Inheritance**: Car and Motorcycle classes classes inherit properties and behaviors from a common base Vehicle class, showing the inheritance relationship.

- **Abstract Classes**: The base class for vehicles may contain abstract methods or properties that derived classes must implement.

- **Enums**: Enumerations define vehicle types and other attributes, such as fuel type and brake type.

- **Structs**: Structs are used for lightweight objects, such as color of the vehicle, showcasing their value type characteristics.
